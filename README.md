How to approach value objects as a clean code practice

## Value objects what are they?

Your typical definition about value objects is:
Kind of objects that are important for what they represent. They don't have an identifier. And they usually wrap a primitive (string, int, or such).

By this definition the options pattern of asp.net is value object, but in my opinion a value object is so much more.
Actually a value object has an identity as of part of domain knowledge, it represents a concept so it encloses business rules.
